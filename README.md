# Code Wars

Tasks from code wars, which I try to do every day. They're short, but I think this is good way to exercise and improve my code. 

I've created basic library app. You can add book, which you've already read or you are going to read. 
There is no possibility to storage data yet, but I would like to improve this app. I'm going to add some elements in the future like:
storage data, rate of book etc.
